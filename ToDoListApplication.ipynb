    "\n",
    "# 1. User Interface (UI):\n",
    "# Create a command-line interface (CLI) for the To-Do List Application.\n",
    "# Display a welcoming message and a menu with the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "#         Welcome to the To-Do List App!\n",
    "\n",
    "#         Menu:\n",
    "#         1. Add a task\n",
    "#         2. View tasks\n",
    "#         3. Mark a task as complete\n",
    "#         4. Delete a task\n",
    "#         5. Quit\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. To-Do List Features:\n",
    "# Implement the following features for the To-Do List:\n",
    "    # Adding a task with a title (by default “Incomplete”).\n",
    "    # Viewing the list of tasks with their titles and statuses (e.g., \"Incomplete\" or \"Complete\").\n",
    "    # Marking a task as complete.\n",
    "    # Deleting a task.\n",
    "    # Quitting the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. User Interaction:\n",
    "# Allow users to interact with the application by selecting menu options using input().\n",
    "# Implement input validation to handle unexpected user input gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Error Handling:\n",
    "# Implement error handling using try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle potential issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Code Organization:\n",
    "# Organize your code into functions to promote modularity and readability.\n",
    "# Use meaningful function names with appropriate comments and docstrings for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Testing and Debugging:\n",
    "# Thoroughly test your application to identify and fix any bugs.\n",
    "# Consider edge cases, such as empty task lists or incorrect user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Documentation:\n",
    "# Include a README file that explains how to run the application and provides a brief overview of its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. Optional Features (Bonus):\n",
    "# If you feel adventurous, you can add extra features like task priorities, due dates, or color-coding tasks based on their status.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. GitHub Repository:\n",
    "# Create a GitHub repository for your project.\n",
    "# Commit your code to the repository regularly.\n",
